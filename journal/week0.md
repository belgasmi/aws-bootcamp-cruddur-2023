# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Fix Gitpod Codespaces issue
-I was not able to push the branch week-0 due to an issue of authentification :
```sh
gitpod /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023 (week-0) $ sudo git push -u origin week-0
Username for 'https://github.com': belgasmi
Password for 'https://belgasmi@github.com': 
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/belgasmi/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023.git/'
```

-I was able to solve the problem with the help of the link below :
https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/1315 
"You can solve it manually by navigating to https://gitpod.io/access-control/ and allowing write public repos"

## Required Homework/Tasks

### AWS CLI

#### Install AWS CLI

- On our GitPod environment, update `.gitpod.yml` to include the following task.

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

- Push the change to GitHub.

- Re'launch GitPod Codespaces

#### Create new User & Generate AWS Credentials

- Go to the [IAM Users Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/users) and create a new user
- `Enable console access` for the user
- Create a new `Admin` Group and apply `AdministratorAccess`
- Create the user and go find and click into the user
- Click on `Security Credentials` and `Create Access Key`
- Choose AWS CLI Access
- Download the CSV with the credentials

- Fix the issue of access authorization for new user on [Account Interface](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-east-1&skipRegion=true#/account)

To fix the problem, I followed the instructions on the [IAM tutorial: Delegate access to the billing console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console) :

```sh
Activate access to billing data on my AWS account
Create IAM policies (BillingFullAccess & BillingViewAccess) that grant permissions to billing data  
Attach billing policies (BillingFullAccess) to your user group
```

#### Set Env Vars

We will set these credentials for the current bash terminal
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

We'll tell Gitpod to remember these credentials if we relaunch our workspaces
```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### Test AWS CLI
Check that the AWS CLI is working and the user is the one expected (the IAM user created `mohamedcloudcamp` 

```sh
gitpod /workspace $ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AIDA3SBLBYGXQYA2DRTXF",
    "Account": "794659242415",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::794659242415:user/mohamedcloudcamp"
}
```

### Enable Billing 

Enable the Billing Alerts to automatically monitor my AWS Service costs.

- In Root Account go to the [Billing Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/)
- Under `Billing Preferences` Choose `Receive Billing Alerts`
- Save Preferences

### Create a Billing Alarm

#### Create SNS Topic

- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

We'll create an SNS Topic
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
which will return a TopicARN
```json
{
    "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:794659242415:billing-alarm"
}
```

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:794659242415:billing-alarm \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint mohamed.nejib.belgasmi@gmail.com
```
Output : 
```json
{
    "SubscriptionArn": "pending confirmation"
}
```

Check the email and confirm the subscription
```sh
You have chosen to subscribe to the topic:
arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:794659242415:billing-alarm

To confirm this subscription, click or visit the link below (If this was in error no action is necessary):
Confirm subscription

Please do not reply directly to this email. If you wish to remove yourself from receiving all future SNS subscription confirmation requests please send an email to sns-opt-out
```

```sh
Subscription confirmed!
You have successfully subscribed.

Your subscription's id is:
arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:794659242415:billing-alarm:d590bb10-4c6a-49a9-9997-5749be7133bb

If it was not your intention to subscribe, click here to unsubscribe.
```

#### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with :
	-the TopicARN we generated earlier 
	and
	-the daily estimated charges to not exceed (Threshold)
- We need just a json file because --metrics is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```
### Create an AWS Budget

[aws budgets create-budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)

Get the AWS Account ID
```sh
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
gp env AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```sh
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```
